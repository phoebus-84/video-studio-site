# Contract catalog

This catalog assigns every durable wire or workspace concept to one contract family. JSON Schema will be canonical; generated TypeScript and Python bindings are projections of these schemas.

## Families

| Family | Durable kinds and records | Primary producer | Primary consumers | Planned Beads |

| `source-pin` | Source Pin: shared material an episode reads without copying (channel source or episode), its file inventory and the stages that read it | `vpr pin add`, series compilers | runtime status, `vpr pin renew` | `avg-7zp.5` |
| `series-template` | Immutable SeriesTemplate release manifest (with optional layout-sheet instants and theme pin), hash-pinned editorial EpisodeSpec, SeriesReference golden snapshot/approval descriptor (ADR-0037) | series authors, the operator's `vpr reference` (approve, withdraw) | Pi/editors, series compiler and QA, the layout sheet, `verifySeriesReference` | `avg-jao.1`, `avg-jao.6`, `avg-3th.1`, `avg-dcf.4.1` |

## Ownership rules

1. This module owns shape, version, examples, and compatibility. It does not own runtime behavior.
2. A durable concept has one canonical family. Other schemas reference it with `$ref`; they do not copy its fields.
3. Provider names, model endpoint IDs, capability names, MIME types, languages, and user labels are open vocabularies represented as constrained strings, not central enums.
4. Control-flow states, approval modes, journal event types, and discriminators are closed vocabularies. Consumers must not invent values.
5. Human prose remains in Markdown bodies; only its envelope, frontmatter, references, and typed derivatives are contracts.
6. Binary media is not embedded. Contracts use portable workspace-relative paths plus content hashes and provenance.

## Boundary review

The catalog was checked against the root `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `WORKSPACE.md`, `PIPELINES.md`, all accepted ADRs through ADR-0022, and the ten module charters. Command-specific REST routes and visual component state are intentionally excluded: gateway APIs compose these domain contracts instead of becoming new production truth.
