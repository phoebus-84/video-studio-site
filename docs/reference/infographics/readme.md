# Remotion Infographic Renderer

A deterministic, local motion-graphics module for technical explainers. It turns a validated JSON production spec into an H.264 infographic video using React and Remotion. It does not call image-generation services or execute repository content.

## Scope

The module owns animated infographic visuals: title cards, comparisons, architecture orbits, command dispatchers, process pipelines, timelines, and end cards. Narration, music mixing, captions, and final delivery remain the video composer's responsibility.

## CLI

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
node dist/cli.js validate ./spec.json
node dist/cli.js render ./spec.json ./visuals.mp4
```

The render is deterministic for a given spec, package version, and font environment. Specs declare resolution, frame rate, palette, scene templates, scene content, and exact frame durations.

## Input shape

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "Example",
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,

      "title": "A precise title",
      "subtitle": "A short explanatory line",
      "items": []
    }
  ]
}
```
