# qwen-tts-worker

Persistent local Qwen3-TTS service optimized for Apple Silicon through MLX.

## Owns

Model discovery/download state, load and unload lifecycle, one reusable model cache, voice profiles, synthesis job queue, progress, cancellation, segment outputs, health/resource diagnostics, and canonical WAV metadata.

It also aligns: `POST /align` returns when each word of a known text is said in an audio file, with Qwen3-ForcedAligner (`QTW_ALIGN_MODEL`, default `mlx-community/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B-8bit`, downloaded and loaded on first use). See [the API contract](./docs/api.md#forced-alignment).

## Design correction over the prototype

The worker does not spawn and reload Python for every Pi tool call. A typed local API keeps models warm and makes narration jobs resumable and observable. Audio transcoding and final mixing remain FFmpeg composer responsibilities.

## Quick start

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/pip install --no-deps -e .
.venv/bin/qwen-tts install 1.7B --profile custom_voice
.venv/bin/qwen-tts serve
```

**Python 3.12 specifically.** `requirements.txt` is hash-pinned and was
compiled with `uv pip compile --python-version 3.12`; those hashes are for
cp312 wheels. On any other interpreter the install dies partway through with
`No matching distribution found` for whichever pin lacks a wheel for your
version — a message that reads like a broken dependency rather than a wrong
`python3`. If `python3.12` is not on your machine, `mise install` in the
repository root fetches it.

API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. For a private per-user LaunchAgent, diagnostics, synthesis, and cloning commands, follow [the macOS CLI guide](./docs/macos-cli.md).

## Tests

```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=src/qwen_tts_worker --cov-report=term-missing
QTW_ALIGN_LIVE=1 pytest tests/test_alignment.py   # also a real alignment (macOS `say` speaks Italian)
```
