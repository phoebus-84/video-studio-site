# video-studio-gateway

Trusted local backend connecting browser clients, the agent (Pi RPC, or Claude through the Claude Agent SDK), and filesystem production state.

## Owns

Pi RPC process lifecycle, strict JSONL framing, session-to-episode association, contextual prompt/steer/follow-up routing, extension UI bridging, workspace read APIs, revision-safe edits, review threads, file watching, projections, authentication, and WebSocket/SSE delivery.

Which agent runs each episode's session is `AVG_AGENT_BACKEND`: `pi` (the default, `src/rpc/process-manager.ts`) or `claude` (`src/rpc/claude-manager.ts`, the same production tools over the agent's MCP server). Both implement `AgentSessionManager`.

## Boundary

The gateway does not make creative decisions and does not replace the pipeline runtime. The browser never receives Pi credentials, provider secrets, or unrestricted filesystem access.

## Plan

Run `bd list`, `bd graph`, and `bd show <id>`.
