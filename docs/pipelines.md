# Pipeline model

## Canonical manifests

Built-in manifests live in `studio/pipelines/pipelines/*.yaml`. They validate
against `studio/contracts/schemas/v1alpha1/pipeline-manifest.schema.json`, not a
second schema invented by a provider. For example:

```yaml
pipeline:
  id: a-scene-workflow
  version: "0.1.0"
  description: "Create an editable 3D scene"
  capabilities:
    - id: scene.create
      version: "1.0.0"
  stages:
    - id: build
      name: "Build Scene"
      type: capability
      capability: scene.create
      inputs: []
      outputs:
        - contract: scene-source.json
          version: "0.1.0"
      gates:
        autopilot: false
        review: human
        retry_on_failure: 1
      skills:
        - skill: blender-scene
          version: "0.1.0"
      depends_on: []
```

Editorial stages use `type: editorial` without a capability. Capabilities describe
what is requested, not which vendor/tool executes it. Versioned series overrides
must preserve a valid dependency graph and satisfiable input/output contracts;
see [ADR-0001](./adr/0001-series-pipelines-use-explicit-inheritance.md).

## Built-in workflows

| ID | Route |
|---|---|
| `narrated-illustrated-video` | Brief, script, art direction, terminal/illustration generation, narration, captions/timing, composition, QA |
| `fairy-tale-adaptation` | Tale ingestion, audience adaptation and reviews plus the narrated path |
| `repository-documentation` | Repository-grounded explanation plus the narrated path |
| `blender-animation` | Shot plan → editable scene → preview/artist handoff → animation → shot acceptance |

`blender-animation` is a **Pi-directed silent-shot workflow**. It does not require
fal, voice synthesis or VHS, and it does not add production handlers to the legacy
gateway executor. The source/preview/render JSON artifacts reference immutable
attempts and source hashes; their conventions are documented in `blender-scene`.
The final MP4 can be a standalone silent shot or a video clip in a mixed-media edit.

## Automation and human direction

The intended common flow is: frozen plan → prerequisite validation → lease →
capability/editorial work → validated candidate → review → accepted selection.
Autopilot, guided and manual should be policies over that same graph. Guided
Blender production uses shot-direction, preview and final acceptance gates;
an artist can Save As a native revision and render that file without rebuilding
it from the original script. Automated runs require an explicitly agreed plan
and budget; a script trust flag is not a human approval.

**Current boundary:** the CLI and gateway share the execution service for
leases, journals, reviews and the spend ledger. Agent pipeline tools reach it
through the gateway and need that service running. Stages with an adapter can
be executed through the service; other stages require agent work through
claim/complete. A declared gate holds stage completion, not every direct media
tool call. Supported paid tools enforce their spend reservations, not a
universal lock on generation. See the [harness review](https://github.com/phoebus-84/video-studio/blob/bfea2f80a4f8a10c999118a4db35b2820ac5c5fc/docs/harness-review.md) before
unattended execution.

## The series-production family

`series-production` (`studio/pipelines/pipelines/series-production.yaml`) is
one pipeline for every series with a template (ADR-0037): the compiler and the
validator are the ones the episode's pinned release names, never the
pipeline's.

| Stage | Performed by | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `spec` → `episode-spec.json` | Pi: `pva_init_spec`, then the `fill-episode-spec` skill | human |
| `pictures` → `images/` | the person or Pi: every picture the spec names, in `assets/images` | human |
| `takes` → `takes.json` | the person or Pi: the narration takes and their word timing | human |
| `timeline` → `edit-timeline.json` | adapter `series-timeline` (the release's compiler) | — |
| `check` → `series-check.json` | adapter `series-check` (the release's validator); errors fail it | human |
| `sheet` → `layout-sheet.json` | adapter `series-sheet` (Remotion): stills at the series' instants and a labelled grid; the `review-layout-sheet` skill | human |
| `render` → `output.mp4` | adapter `series-render` (`video.compose`, Remotion); refuses a missing or stale sheet. The person's approval of the `sheet` stage at its gate is the sheet's review here; outside the pipeline a render needs `vpr sheet approve` (avg-3th.2) | human |

A series extends it and replaces stages by id (ADR-0001). The example
`studio/pipelines/fixtures/valid/series-local/poetry-short.yaml` keeps every
stage and replaces `takes` with the poem's recital:

```yaml
pipeline:
  id: poetry-short
  version: "1.0.0"
  extends:
    pipeline: series-production
    version: "1.1.0"
  stages:
    - id: takes
      name: "Recital Take"
      # same contracts as the base stage; the poem's own instructions
```

Stages that depend on unfinished work arrive as new versions of the base:
take synthesis, alignment and verification (`avg-8hs.*`) turn `takes` into
capability stages; the render audit (`avg-3th.3`) and the delivery package
(`avg-3th.5`) follow `render`. Version 1.1.0 added the layout sheet
(`avg-3th.1`) between `check` and `render`; an episode resolved on 1.0.0 keeps
its snapshot.

## Adding a workflow

1. Reuse provider-neutral capabilities and typed media outputs.
2. Declare stage inputs/outputs, dependencies, skills and gates explicitly.
3. Avoid requiring irrelevant capabilities for every shot; optional input files
   alone do not make a stage optional.
4. Use a typed video timeline for mixed clips; never reduce Blender animation to
   an image-concat input.
5. Validate manifests and test a real user route through the agent, not just the
   package API.

```bash
npm run check:pipelines
```

skills, diagnostics, tests and documentation.
