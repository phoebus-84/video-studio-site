# Qwen3-TTS runs as a long-lived worker

Local speech synthesis runs through a persistent worker that loads MLX models once, queues segment-level jobs, reports progress, supports cancellation, and returns canonical WAV assets with metadata. Pi talks to this worker through production tools rather than spawning a Python script per request, avoiding repeated multi-gigabyte model loads while keeping the service contract open to future local TTS backends.
