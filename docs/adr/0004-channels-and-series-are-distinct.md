# Channels and series are distinct

A channel owns publication identity, audience, brand, and platform defaults, while a series owns the conventions of one recurring format within that channel. Episodes belong to exactly one series, and configuration inherits from system defaults through channel and series to episode; initialization may create a default channel to keep single-series use simple.
