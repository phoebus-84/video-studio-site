# Stages request capabilities, not providers

Pipeline stages declare provider-neutral capabilities and artifact contracts, while the Pi executive producer records an explicit provider binding in the episode snapshot before execution. Adapters never perform silent provider fallback, so a new model or local backend can be introduced without rewriting pipelines and any material provider change remains visible, reviewable, and reproducible.
