> Imported studio reference, based on [bfea2f8](https://github.com/phoebus-84/video-studio/tree/bfea2f80a4f8a10c999118a4db35b2820ac5c5fc) with local source edits. This is a versioned snapshot, not a live dependency. [Update policy](/site-maintenance#technical-reference-snapshot).

# Modules have independent Git and Beads history

Each system module is an independent Git repository and Beads workspace with its own release and dependency-aware plan. Integration happens through versioned contracts rather than a shared monorepo build, accepting additional release coordination in exchange for replaceable adapters, independently testable boundaries, and the user's requirement that the studio remain a collection of tools and Pi packages rather than one application.
