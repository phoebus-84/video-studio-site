# fal uses a dedicated provider adapter

The MVP integrates fal.ai only through a dedicated provider adapter rather than exposing fal's MCP server to the production agent. The adapter owns endpoint invocation, asynchronous job persistence, cancellation and resumption, output download, provenance, and cost reconciliation; model discovery through MCP can be reconsidered later without changing the pipeline or asset contracts.
